# buf_t
C buffer management framework

The buf_t project is a robust, secure, and efficient memory buffers management library written in C and designed for C programming language. It provides a set of APIs that enable developers to allocate, release, and securely manage memory. 

The library offers three types of buffers, including a generic, string, and array, each designed to cater to different use cases. 

The buf_t library internally allocates and releases memory, and when the buffer is no longer needed, it securely releases all internal buffer memory. It ensures that the memory is cleared by filling it with zeros before calling it 'free(), ' which makes it difficult for hackers to exploit the system.

The buf_t library allows the buffer to grow or shrink the memory as required dynamically. For string buffers, it ensures that the null terminator is kept at the end of the string, and when a new string is added, it automatically manages the null terminator. 

Additionally, developers can add a "canary" suffix to the memory buffer, making it easy to detect memory damage in case of unwanted modifications. Overall, the buf_t library provides a secure and reliable way to manage memory buffers for C programming.
