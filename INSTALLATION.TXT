How to deploy

1. Clone this project:
# git clone --recursive  git@github.com:mountaniol/pepa.git

2. Run 'deploy' script:
# ./scripts/deploy.sh

Note: You should run 'deploy.sh' only once.
This script prepares the project: installs dependencies then brings git submodules and compiles them.
Every following compilation, even after 'git pull,' does not require the deploy script to run.

3. Run one of the targets:
# make
or
# make all
or
# make pepa emu
or to compile a static version of the PEPA explicitly:
# make static

NOTE: If you run 'make' or 'make all' target, it will:
a. Run 'clean' 
b. Compile a static version of PEPA
